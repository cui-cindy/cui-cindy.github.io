  1. As Willow looked at the new beta, he frowned. Charcoal was a sarcastic wolf and the sparrow clan lost to the midnight clan. Willow was part of the sparrow clan and was spending his time getting bullied by midnights. As Charcoal battled the alpha, it looked for sure that Mist would win. Mist lost, however, and Charcoal took over sparrow clan and became The Alpha for two teams! Then a midnight wolf went to him. Willow thought he would be dead! The midnight wolf said, WILLOW CHARCOAL WANTS TO HUNT YOU DOWN!!!  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/619576776/">||Charcoal in Sparrow Clan||</a> 2. Willow was SHOCKED. He said, Midnight, what are you doing here? Come and beat me. The midnight petrifiedly explained that he was a messenger and he cannot beat wolves up; he didn't want to. Willow said that he needed to talk to Mist and is the midnight will be willing to message the souls of Mist. One moon (day) passed. 30 moons passed as he waited in vain. Finally, Mist said, Some messenger wolf sent me here to protect you. i will protect you with my final 4 lives!
