  1. As Willow looked at the new beta, he frowned. Charcoal was a sarcastic wolf and the sparrow clan lost to the midnight clan. Willow was part of the sparrow clan and was spending his time getting bullied by midnights. As Charcoal battled the alpha, it looked for sure that Mist would win. Mist lost, however, and Charcoal took over sparrow clan and became The Alpha for two teams! Then a midnight wolf went to him. Willow thought he would be dead! The midnight wolf said, WILLOW CHARCOAL WANTS TO HUNT YOU DOWN!!!  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/619576776/">||Charcoal in Sparrow Clan||</a> 
  2. Willow was SHOCKED. He said, Midnight, what are you doing here? Come and beat me. The midnight petrifiedly explained that he was a messenger and he cannot beat wolves up; he didn't want to. Willow said that he needed to talk to Mist and is the midnight will be willing to message the souls of Mist. One moon (day) passed. 30 moons passed as he waited in vain. Finally, Mist said, Some messenger wolf sent me here to protect you. i will protect you with my final 4 lives! A sparrow messenger wolf whizzed by as she said, "THE MIDNIGHT CLAN DEFEATED THE BADGER CLAN! THEY ARE ONE STEP FROM RULING WOLF PLANET!" 
  3. Mist and Willow said, WHAAATTT-? Willow explained how Mist should only have one life left. Mist asked if a messenger in Badger could ask what Charcoal looks like, and the badger messenger described: black furred, white tail tip, green eyes, half-eyed (blind by one eye) and shortter by a claw or two (claws are wolf inches). When Willow asks what his weaknesses were, the answer was a lime-colored crystal! Mist explained how it will be tricky to defeat Charcoal. She said, we barely and rarely get to see Charcoal. He is a coward sometimes and hides out in the dungeon.
  4. Willow said, well is Charcoal sly? The answer was that Charcoal was as sly as a snake.
