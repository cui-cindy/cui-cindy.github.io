 As Willow looked at the new beta, he frowned. Charcoal was a sarcastic wolf and the sparrow clan lost to the midnight clan. Willow was part of the sparrow clan and was spending his time getting bullied by midnights. As Charcoal battled the alpha, it looked for sure that Mist would win. Mist lost, however, and Charcoal took over sparrow clan and became The Alpha for two teams! Then a midnight wolf went to him. Willow thought he would be dead! The midnight wolf said, wanna be pallllllsss?
